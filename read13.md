## Bearer Authorization

* Write the following steps in correct order:
  * Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
  * Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
  * Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
  * Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
  * Receive Authorization Code
  * Make a request to the access token enpoint
  * Receive Access Token
  
* What can you do with an authorization code?
  * Leverage an authorization code to be granted an access token

* What can you do with an access token?
  * Access tokens allow applications to make API requests on behalf of a user. It represents authorization to specific parts of a user's data.

* What's a benefit of using OAuth instead of basic authentication?
  * User login information is never stored in a database. 

### Vocabulary

* **Client ID** - Client IDs are public identifiers for apps, typically implemented as a hex string. Although public, it is best kept secure to avoid any phishing attacks
* **Client Secret** - A secret only know to the application and authorization server. Must not be guessable
* **Authentication Endpoint** - Used to request access tokens or authorization codes
  - [github](https://identityserver.github.io/Documentation/docsv2/endpoints/authorization.html)
* **Access Token Endpoint** - Where applications make a request to get an access token on behalf of a user
  - [oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)
* **API Endpoint** - Unique URL that acts as a touchpoint with another system it interacts with
* **Authorization Code** - Temporary code that client exchanges for access token. Obtained from authorization server.
* **Access Token** -  Credential provided by authorization server in exchange for authorization code, granted client access to an API on behalf of a user

* Service makes a boolean decision regarding the success of a login attempt
* This applies to both Basic Authentication (username and password) or OAuth (server to server handshaking)
* **Bearer Token** - Secondary authentication as a workaround to repeatedly obtaining username and password or proceeding through cumbersome OAuth process
* **Bearer Tokens** - encoded JSON objects that contain sufficient information for the server to confirm that any client request with a valid token must have come from a previously authenticated client with either Basic or OAuth. 
* Sent to client after initial signin process
* Client must make every additional request with bearer token
* Example header - `Authorization: Bearer encoded.jsonwebtoken.here`
* Server opens token, re-authenticates and then grants/denies access
* Can be performed in middleware with Express servers


### Bearer Authorization
Also known as token authentication. An HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. THis can be understood as "give access to this token". It is a cryptic string, usually generated by the serverin response to a login request. 
 `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

#### 401 Response
Can also be defined "Unauthorized", and can be globally defined. 
```js
    paths:
      /something:
        get:
          ...
          responses:
            '401':
              $ref: '#/components/responses/UnauthorizedError'
            ...
        post:
          ...
          responses:
            '401':
              $ref: '#/components/responses/UnauthorizedError'
            ...
    components:
      responses:
        UnauthorizedError:
          description: Access token is missing or invalid
 ```
 

### JSON Web Tokens

```js
$ npm install jsonwebtoken
```
JSON Web Token is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This can be verified and trusted. JWT's can be signed using secret or public key pair.

Authorization, the most common scenario for using JWT. Once logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT.

Information Exchange, JWT's are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Information can also be checked for tampering using the header and payload information.

JSON Web Token structure
- Header
- Paylod
- Signature
(xxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz)

#### Header
```js
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
#### Payload
```js
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```
3333 Signature
```js
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
  ```
