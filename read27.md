# Props and State

## Review, Research and Discussion

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?
  - React does not use a web server, it builds the virtual DOM and does its different operations on the client's browser.
  - SOURCE: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26696204/does-react-js-require-server-side)
2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  - BEcause then we can test the actual interaction the user is having with the React components rather than testing what is "under the hood". 
3. What does npm run build do?
  - It lets you perform any necessary building/prep tasks for your project, prior to it being used in another project.

4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

## Vocab Terms

* BDD
  - Behavior Driven Development is an agile software development practice that encourages collaboration netween everyne involved in developing software. BDD describes application behavior from a userâ€™s point of view. Overall, the main goal of BDD is to improve the collaboration between all stakeholders involved in developing software and form a shared understanding among them.

* Acceptance Tests
  - An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.

* mounting
  - Mounting is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components).In a browser that would mean outputting a React Element into an actual DOM element (e.g. an HTML div or li element) in the DOM tree.
